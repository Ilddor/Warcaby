Warcaby
=======
Project created for university laboratories.

The main goal of project is to create self learning AI which would participate vs players in game named Warcaby
(Polish name of Draughts). Bot would gather information about sets and moves of played games and store it in memory,
so in future games it would decide which move is the best for a moment depending on his memory.

# Installation #
So far project is available only as source code with project files for MS Visual Studio 11.
To compile the project you will need SFML library in version 2.0, 
you can get code here: https://github.com/LaurentGomila/SFML or on page http://sfml-dev.org/

In project files are used enviroment variables(SFML_include for include directory and SFML_lib for library directory)
of course you can change these variables for static paths.

If you have all done you can compile it and test it, if you see any bug feel free to report it, we will fix it as soon as possible.
